# Rosetta Stats
Rosetta Stats is a statistics chrestomathy, conceptually based on Rosetta Code. See the GitHub pages site at http://rosettastats.com for the site itself.

Rosetta Stats was founded mainly to facilitate using SPSS and R in parallel or to facilitate switching from SPSS to R. It is geared towards application of statistics to psychological science.

It is free and open source: everybody can contribute. If you would like to contribute, please keep in mind the following:

- Rosetta Stats is not a resource to learn R. It is a list with simple one-on-one 'translations' of commands and analyses in SPSS and R, geared towards pragmatic researchers. Therefore, this is not the place for explaining the virtues of the `*apply` family of functions or to even demonstrate how a function can be defined. The goal is to demonstrate how R is not more complicated than SPSS for the day-to-day tasks most researchers perform. Of course, this means that Rosetta Stats can be *used* to learn R, alongside other material, especially with an audience that came from SPSS.

- Try to keep the number of `require`d packages to a minimum. The strategy of Rosetta Stats is to code wrappers for common SPSS functions and include them in the `userfriendlyscience` package (see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Matherion/userfriendlyscience) or [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=userfriendlyscience)). This makes it easy to actually provide commands that acts roughly like their SPSS counterparts.

Of course, feel free to contact us to discuss your involvement!
