This site is meant to illustrate how common analyses can be conducted in a variety of statistical software packages. It was founded mainly to facilitate using SPSS and R in parallel.

## Data preprocessing

Before analyses can be conducted, it is sometimes necessary to perform some preprocessing.

- [Recoding a variable](recoding.html)

## Univariate analyses

Univariate analyses are analyses of only one variable, for example to inspect distributions or frequencies.

- [Descriptives](descriptives.html)
- [Descriptives split by group](descriptives-by-group.html)

## Bivariate analyses

Bivariate analyses are analyses of associations between two variables.

- Two continuous variables: [correlation](correlation.html) and [regression](regression-single.html)
- One dichotomous variable, one continuous variable: [independent-samples t-test](t-test-independent.html)
- One categorical variable, one continuous variable: [oneway analysis of variance](anova-oneway.html)
- Two categorical variables: [crosstable](crosstab.html)

## Multivariate analyses

Multivariate analyses involve more than two variables.

- [Regression analysis](regression-multiple.html)
- [Factorial analysis of variance](anova-factorial.html)
- [Repeated measures analysis of variance](anova-repeated-measures.html)
